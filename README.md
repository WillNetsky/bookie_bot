## Bookie Bot

# Idea
* A bot that will sit in our discord and let us place wagers on sporting events for fictional currency
* The fictional currency could be accrued by spending time in voice channels
* The whole project should be free. Hosted on LemonHost.me for persistence.
* Ideally we would utilize a free API with as many different things to wager on as possible. 
* Live betting should be accomodated within the ability of our host.

# Archiecture

# TODO
